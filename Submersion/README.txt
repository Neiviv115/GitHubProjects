Welcome to the Project Submersion AR Museum, an Android application developed for the 3LAM Laboratory (Laboratory of Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics of Angers and Le Mans). This app brings the world of Jason de Caires Taylor's underwater statues to users in an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience. Dive into a virtual museum where these submerged sculptures come to life, complete with animated reflections, vibrant corals, enhancing the overall sense of immersion.
